# Permenant Razor Sword

Do you *(like me)* love the look of the Razor Sword, but think that the 100 swing limit makes it kinda pointless? Then I have the mod for you! This mod makes the Razor Sword a permenant sword upgrade, like the Gilded Sword. It no londer reverts to the Kokiri sword after 100 uses, and is preserved when playing the Song of Time.

This does not invalidate the existence of the Gilded Sword, since the Gilded Sword does 3x the damage of the Kokiri Sword, whereas the Razor Sword only does 2x.

In addition, all in-game messages and dialog related to the Razor Sword have been updated to reflect the Razor Sword's new status as a permanent upgrade. The Mountain Blacksmith won't talk about how it will dull after 100 swings.

This mod requires [EZ Text Replacer API](https://thunderstore.io/c/zelda-64-recompiled/p/LT_Schmiddy/EZ_Text_Replacer_API/) to handle dialog replacement.
