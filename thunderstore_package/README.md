# Permenant Razor Sword

The Razor Sword is now a permenant weapon upgrade, like the Gilded Sword.

Does not effect the any in-game dialog at this time. In addition, there is a known bug where the
blacksmith will not recognize that you have the Razor Sword when you reset time.

These will be fixed in a future update.
